        <p>
          Each of our daycare classrooms are staffed by qualified Early
          Childhood Educators. Assistant Teachers in each classroom work in
          co-operation with the lead teacher to provide quality programming in
          all areas of the Early Childhood Curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Before & After School Program, as well as Full Day Programs, are
          staffed by a Program Provider (either ECE or approved designate), a
          Program Assistant, and where necessary, a Child Care Program Assistant
          (for children with special/high needs).

        <p>
          Macaulay Tree House is governed by a 10 member volunteer Board of
          Directors, primarily consisting of, but not restricted to, parents
          whose children attend our programs. In September the Board holds its
          Annual General Meeting. At this meeting all parties interested in
          joining the Board are asked to attend and put their name forward to be
          nominated. Board members are elected for a two-year term and this
          meeting is open to the public.
